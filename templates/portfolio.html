                <p>Hello, I'm Ishaan S. Oshima a 20 year old crusing through the twists and turns of life.</p>
                <p><em>Being a driven 2nd year CSE student at SMIT, with a curiosity fuelled hunger for exploring the intricate world of technology. Cryptography and Cybersecurity are my current playground,
                    where I enjoy unraveling the complexities of digital defense and building robust security solutions. But my curiosity extends beyond, leading 
                    me to delve into the fascinating realms of AI and Machine Learning, eager to understand how these powerful tools can shape the future.
                    If i don’t get in my own way then, i would love to explore Flutter.
                </em></p>
                <p><em>In Delhi, you may find me conquering new roads on my bicycle, relishing the thrill of the open air and the satisfaction of pushing my limits.
                    While at college, during evenings I love playing the drop shots and receiving smashes from opponents at the badminton court.When I'm not going 
                    all out at the court or coding, I unwind with a good dose of K-dramas, immersing myself in the vibrant storytelling and cultural insights they 
                    offer(all that being said I do love a lovely romantic story among other types of stories).
                    The legendary opening line of Star Trek-“To boldly go where no one has gone”, is my philosophy while i curiously travel on my knowledge quest.
                    I'm always up for a challenge, eager to learn from experienced professionals and collaborate with like-minded individuals.</em></p>
                <p><em>Connect with me if you're looking for a passionate comrade who's always on the lookout for new frontiers to explore!
